# Fin geometry spec

Every number here is stated on camera by Slant3D in *How to Design Better Support Fins
for 3D Printing* (youtube.com/watch?v=vnn4XeKQobs). These are not our guesses. Where we
deviate, this file says so and why.

## The shape

A support fin is **a gap and a grab**, and both halves matter:

- The **fin body** is a thin wall standing off the part face by a clearance — it props
  the part up, exactly like a slicer support.
- The **tines** are tiny horizontal bridges that *fuse into the part*. They're what make
  it a **combined** support.

A fin with no tines only holds the part in one direction. The part falls *away* from it
sideways — Slant3D demos a real cube that did exactly that, mid-print. **Tines are the
entire point, not a refinement.**

## Dimensions

| feature | value | rationale |
|---|---|---|
| fin body standoff | **0.2 mm** from the part face | "spaced exactly 0.2mm away the same way support would be" |
| tine height (vertical) | **one layer line** (0.3 mm at Slant3D's layer height; **0.2 mm here**, matching the print's layer height) | a single bead is enough; smaller ⇒ smaller divot. Must equal the *slicer's* layer height or it slices into 1.5 layers and stops being one continuous bead |
| tine width | **0.4–0.8 mm** | 0.4 = one nozzle pass, 0.8 = out-and-back. Prefer the smallest that prints. |
| tine count | **7–8 near the base**, spreading out with height | the part is least stable early. ~5 is usually enough. |
| tine spacing (upper) | every few layers | "just to make sure everything is fully reinforced" |
| base | wide **ellipse**, **1 mm** thick disc | bed adhesion without leaving a veneer to scrape off |
| part bottom edge | **~2 mm chamfer** | a tilted part otherwise starts on a single line and peels off the bed |
| fin top | **rounded**, never pointed | a sharp tip is a retraction point that causes defects |
| placement | on an **edge or corner** | hides the tine pockmarks; never the middle of a visible face |
| long parts | **two fins**, opposite sides | a single fin lets the part twist and fall |

## Why the tines must be horizontal

A horizontal tine prints as **one continuous layer line**: the nozzle travels along the
fin, crosses into the tine, into the part, and back out — **no retraction**. It is a
single strong bead.

A perpendicular (vertical) tine is its own little tower, grown one dot per layer. The
nozzle deposits a tiny amount each pass, so the tines are frail, may not print at all,
may never contact the part, and add a retraction each. Slant3D: *"This is the worst way
of doing it."*

There's a removal benefit too: because horizontal tines lie in the plane of the layer
lines, you **bend** them to fatigue and snap clean, instead of tearing them and leaving
welts.

## Claims we can make (his, on camera)

- Uses less material than tree supports.
- Removes "in a fraction of a second"; at 0.5 mm the marks "have basically no presence at all."
- **Slicer-, machine-, and material-independent** — it's in the STL, so it prints right
  wherever it's sent. This is the property no slicer can provide, because a slicer's
  output is gcode for one machine.
- Diagonal layer lines ⇒ stronger part.
- All edges look good — no distinct top/bottom surface finish.

## Where we deviate

- **`breakaway_wall()` in the prototype is gap-only, no tines — and tines cannot be added
  to it.** The prototype sweeps its wall *under* the contact line, topping out 0.2 mm
  below the part, so the only gap it leaves is vertical, and a tine across a vertical gap
  is the failure mode above. A wall can pass under the contact line *or* rise above it,
  never both: at the contact height the part touches the wall's plane, so it would have to
  pinch to zero thickness there.

  So the fin has to stand **beside** the part, off a near-vertical face, and let the
  **tines carry the load** — which is what "combined" means, and why placement is "on an
  edge or corner." Measured across the 11-model test set (`prototype/probe_tines*.py`):
  66% of contact-line stations take a tine ≤ 1.5 mm, and 13/20 overhang regions have a
  vertical face tall enough to stand a fin against. **That ~65% ceiling is why manual fin
  placement is a core feature, not a fallback.**
- **Scale-aware profile.** The prototype's foot/chamfer/tip are fixed, which degenerates
  into a 14 mm splayed sheet when the overhang sits low. Foot width must scale with wall
  height.
- **The 2 mm bottom chamfer modifies the user's part**, not just adds a fin. That's a
  bigger permission ask — surface it explicitly in the UI, don't do it silently.
  **DECISION (2026-09-02): do NOT build it. The breakaway bed pad solves the same
  bed-adhesion problem without touching the user's geometry** (quality-first). Don't
  re-litigate unless a real print shows the pad alone can't hold a tilted-onto-an-edge
  part. (Everything else Slant3D shows in vnn4XeKQobs — rounded top, ellipse pad,
  corner placement, 0.3×0.5 horizontal tines, two-fins-opposite, one-STL — is already
  implemented; this chamfer is the only spec feature we intentionally skip.)

## Sway braces (tall parts) — `web/sway.js`

Not from the video; an extension for tall, slender parts that drift, sag or wobble
as they grow. Nothing overhangs, but the nozzle's drag and each layer shrinking as
it cools push the top around, and every movement leaves a visible layer line. Off by
default ("Sway braces (tall parts)" in the options panel).

| feature | value | rationale |
|---|---|---|
| orientation | vertical rib, **edge-on** to an upright face (≤ 30° lean) | a plate lying flat against the face bends the easy way exactly when the part leans into it; edge-on is its stiff direction |
| inner edge | the breakaway gap (Support gap) off the face | same standoff as every other support |
| depth | **15%** of rib height at the bed ("Brace depth"), tapering to 4 mm at the top | stiffer than the part at the bottom, where the lever arm is longest; a flat top, never a point |
| thickness | 1.2 mm + 0.004 mm per mm of height, max 2.4 mm | a 250 mm rib at 1.2 mm is more slender than the part it holds |
| tines | one layer, one bead wide, **evenly spaced** (default 6 mm, "Brace tine spacing") from "Brace grip from" to the top | the sway is at the top; the Brace's dense-low, 1.6×-spreading rows left the top of a tall part untied |
| grip floor | ≥ 3 tines and ≥ 30% of the rows must find the face | a tall rib tied on at a few points still lets the part wave about between them |
| auto placement | up to 4 faces with bearings ≥ 60° apart, a rib per ~100 mm of face width, at the face's **tallest** columns | holds both axes; a rib at a gable's low end braces the half that wasn't moving |
| manual | Draw mode: one click on an upright side; click a placed support to select it, Delete / "Remove selected" to take it out | |
| clash check | ≥ 1 mm of air between braces, compared at the same heights (feet on the plate, ribs every 10 mm up) | two ribs on facing walls of a channel reach toward each other; fused, they are one bar that neither snaps off nor breaks away |

## Naming

Slant3D says "grip fins" once. Unrelated to the *grip fin* used elsewhere in Matthew's
CAD work (a tolerance-absorbing feature for mating holes). Don't collide the terms.
